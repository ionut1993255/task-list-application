Welcome to the Task List App !!!

The general ideea behind this app is to have a way to manage a list of tasks.
As functionalities go, you can add a new task from the input present in the single page app.
The task that you added is saved in the Firebase API by way of a "POST" method.

The app was developed in React with the help of HTML & CSS and I used Promises to send the input content to the Firebase API along with 'async/await' functions.

The purpose behind this app is to just save my daily tasks.

Check out the custom favicon *wink *wink

Hope you enjoy !!!
